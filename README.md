# Forms_Assessment

In this programming exercise you will be practicing making forms, getting form values, submit event listeners, DOM manipulation.

Your finished product should be a Github URL with one HTML and one JavaScript file inside it (One per group, collaborate on the assignment).

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Make a header in your HTML that says "Add a Todo"
Make a form in your HTML that collects a single input (a new todo)
Make a header below the form that says "Todo List"
When you submit the form, a new todo should pop up in your todo list.
Submitting the form again should add another todo below the previous todo.
Commit all your code into a repository
Push your repository to github
There are a number of ways to implement the functionality described above. I recommend the following:

Use an array to keep track of the todos (Meaning every time the form is submitted, you push the new value onto the array)
Build a template from the array using the map method learned about in programming exercise 6.
Display the template on the screen
